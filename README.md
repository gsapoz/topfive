# topfive
A web scraper that automatically compiles a json list for all players and clubs from Europe's Top Five Leagues

This PHP engine generates a JSON file on click, scraping data from reputable fixture aggregator sites like eurosport.com and fotmob.com, making it possible to keep various npm soccer packages (like gsapoz/topfive-api, for example) up to date, which in turn makes it possible to impelemnt fun community-based formation builders and strategy apps like createformation.com and, of course, gsapoz/xiformation!
